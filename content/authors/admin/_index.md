I recently earned my PhD in Computer Science from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the guidance of Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). My thesis committee included esteemed members Prof. ChengXiang Zhai, Prof. Kathleen McKeown, Prof. Hao Peng, Prof. Han Zhao, and Dr. Shaiq Joty. Throughout my doctoral study, I was supported by the DARPA [Semantic Forensics](https://www.darpa.mil/program/semantic-forensics) program and the [Amazon Science Ph.D. Fellowship](https://cs.illinois.edu/news/Amazon-names-Huang-Zhong-inagural-fellows-AICE-research). 


My primary research interst lies in the intersection between Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My research is driven by a goal to reduce false information around the world. To achieve this goal, I work towards several main research directions: fact-checking ([COLING 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.86/)), fake news detection ([NAACL 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.40/), [ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.815/)), faithfulness enhancement and evaluation ([EACL 2023 Findings](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.37/), [NAACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09521), [NAACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09369)), and factual error correction ([ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.311/), [Arxiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10160)).
